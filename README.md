# ChatGPT-Clone
 
A ChatGPT clone project using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript and integrated it with the OpenAI API. If you’re unfamiliar, ChatGPT is an advanced chatbot model developed by OpenAI. It uses artificial intelligence to generate human-like responses in a conversational format. This ChatGPT clone project allows you to ask questions and receive instant responses. Additionally, you have the option to switch between dark and light themes. Your chat history is saved in the browser’s local storage, ensuring it remains even if you refresh the page. However, you can easily delete chats by clicking on the dedicated “Delete Chat” button.

"This ChatGPT is not yet ready to generate chats based on prompts. To make it functional, you have to paste an “OpenAI API key” into the API_KEY variable. To get your API key, visit the following URL: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys. Once there, log in to your account, and you will be able to generate a free API key. Remember that when you sign up for OpenAI, you’ll get a free $5 credit for your API usage. If your account is older than 3 months or the credit runs out, you’ll need a paid account or create a new one with a new number to keep using the API. Your API usage and expiration date can be found on the account’s usage page."
